As my previous blogposts already covered how to set up a private Maven repository, you might wonder "Why again a Maven blogpost?". Well that's a fair question and the answer is twofold:

1. Backup mechanism, to ensure you never ever loose releases.
2. Remote access outside of your local network (intranet).

As Git implicitly solves both challenges, you'll see why this blogpost makes sense.

I'll demonstrate how to configure Bitbucket and setup a free private remote Maven repository. Evidently, a fully integrated Gradle script will handle all the uploading complexity for you. ;-)

## Preface
While you could use any Git repository (like GitHub), I choose Bitbucket as it offers [free private repositories](https://bitbucket.org/product/pricing) for small teams. Furthermore it has an API which we will need for some of wizardry later on.

All source code is available on Github and can be used after some minor BitBucket configuration.

## Bitbucket
Without any further a do, lets get to it and start configuring BitBucket.

### Basic configuration
Login to Bitbucket and create a new private repository called `maven_repository`.

Checkout the repository locally, create a `README.md` file and commit that file to your local branch. Now push that branch to BitBucket, BUT make sure to push it to a remote branch called "releases". (this is key, as the plugin we'll use later on depends on this)

<center><a href="{{ site.blogbaseurl }}img/blog/wagongit/releasebranch.png"><img src="{{ site.blogbaseurl }}img/blog/wagongit/releasebranch.png" alt="BitBucket repository with main branch releases."></a></center>

> **Troubleshooting releases branch**
> If you accidentally push your local branch to a remote called `master`, create a new branch locally called releases, push that to a remote `releases` and change your main branch in the BitBucket settings for that repository.

Note that in case you accidentally push your local branch to a remote branch called master:


### Running Android unit tests
While running normal unit tests is straight forward, Android tests are a different story because they require an Android emulator to run on. And because Travis support for Android is still in [beta](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/android/), there are a couple of limitations to consider:

1. Only `armeabi-v7a` emulators are supported.
2. The Android M emulator is not yet supported.

> **Extra limitations of Travis Android support**
>
> You can *skip this if you want*, just some extra context
>
> First of all, Travis does not yet support HAXM to speed up intel emulators, so there is no speed up while using an `x86` emulator. Even more, the latest `x86_64 Android M` emulator requires hardware acceleration, so that one simply cannot be used on Travis! For more information see issue [1419](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1419) and [1395](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1395) or check out this [failing build](https://travis-ci.org/JeroenMols/LandscapeVideoCamera/builds/88619658#L693).
>
> Secondly, Travis does not yet support the latest Android M emulator, causing the built-in `android-wait-for-emulator` script to time out while the emulator is booting. Therefore I recommend to use the `android-22` emulator instead. For more information see this [failing build](https://travis-ci.org/JeroenMols/LandscapeVideoCamera/builds/88620580#L1069).

So you'll have to accept that builds will be slow (starting emulator + running test) and that you cannot use an Android M emulator. But if these are acceptable, read on and I'll explain how to set up everything for running tests.

First of all, define the Android version and processor architecture of the emulator by adding a new environment at the top of the `travis.yml` file:

```yaml
env:
  matrix:
    - ANDROID_TARGET=android-22 ANDROID_ABI=armeabi-v7a
```

Then, ensure that all dependencies for the Android emulator are installed, by adding both the platform version and emulator image to the `components` section. Note that it is important to add both, because the Android emulator will only install if the corresponding Android platform is installed (see this [failing build](https://travis-ci.org/JeroenMols/LandscapeVideoCamera/builds/88631850#L815)).

```yaml
android:
  components:
    ...
    - android-22
    - sys-img-armeabi-v7a-android-22
```

Now we need to create a new Android emulator and start it before our build. As starting takes a really long time, Travis offers a built-in `android-wait-for-emulator` script to facilitate this. Finally we need to unlock the emulator once started by sending a key event.

```yaml
before_script:
    - echo no | android create avd --force -n test -t $ANDROID_TARGET --abi $ANDROID_ABI
    - emulator -avd test -no-skin -no-audio -no-window &
    - android-wait-for-emulator
    - adb shell input keyevent 82 &
```

After all of this configuration, all we need to do is change the `Gradle` command to run all of the tests and trigger a new build by pushing all these changes.

```yaml
script:
    - ./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

### Taking things further
As mentioned in the introduction, Travis is a really feature rich CI service. Therefore this section provides some tips to take things even further.

1. **Build notifications:** Travis supports sending notifications via Slack, HipChat, email,... whenever a built fails/succeeds.</p>
For more information, have a look at the [Travis documentation](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/notifications/).

```yaml
notifications:
    email:
      - your.email@gmail.com
```

- **Build status badge:** Click the build badge on your Travis homepage to generate png/markdown/... build badges.</p>
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JeroenMols/TravisCoverallsExample.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JeroenMols/TravisCoverallsExample)

- **Branch information:** Print which branch or pull request is being built.

```yaml
script:
    - echo "Travis branch is $TRAVIS_BRANCH"
    - echo "Travis branch is in pull request $TRAVIS_PULL+REQUEST"
```

- **More options:** Have a look at the [Travis documentation](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/android/).

## Coveralls
### About
[Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) is a visually attractive online code coverage tool which provides detailed statistics such as line coverage and repository trends. Furthermore it allows you to show of your code coverage and encourages you to increase it. Like Travis, it is free for open source projects, but a subscription service is available for private repositories.

<center><a href="{{ site.blogbaseurl }}img/blog/traviscoveralls/coveralls-example.png"><img src="{{ site.blogbaseurl }}img/blog/traviscoveralls/coveralls-example.png" alt="Example coveralls dashboard"></a></center>

### Enabling Android code coverage
First of all, your Android project needs to be configured to generate code coverage reports. As such, ensure that you are using at least version 0.4 of the [Android testing support library](https://google.github.io/android-testing-support-library/) (there was an [issue](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=170607) in version 0.3).

Then add the flag `testCoverageEnabled` to the debug buildTypes in your main module's `build.gradle` file, causing a code coverage report to be generated in the `build/reports/coverage/` folder.

```groovy
android {
  ...

  buildTypes {
        debug {
            testCoverageEnabled true
        }
    }
}
```

At this point, you should be able to run `gradle connectedAndroidTest` and view an `html` and `xml` report in the above mentioned directory.

<center><a href="{{ site.blogbaseurl }}img/blog/traviscoveralls/coveralls-rawcoverage.png"><img src="{{ site.blogbaseurl }}img/blog/traviscoveralls/coveralls-rawcoverage.png" alt="Basic coverage report generated by the built in Android code coverage"></a></center>

### Basic configuration
In order to get started, go to [coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/), login with your GitHub account and authorize Coveralls to access your repositories.

<center><a href="{{ site.blogbaseurl }}img/blog/traviscoveralls/coveralls-authorize.png"><img src="{{ site.blogbaseurl }}img/blog/traviscoveralls/coveralls-authorize.png" alt="Allow Coveralls to access your GitHub projects"></a></center>

Next, we'll need to configure your `build.gradle` files to upload the coverage reports to Coveralls after each successful CI build. Therefore add a new classpath dependency to the root projects `build.gradle` file.

```groovy
buildscript {
    ...

    dependencies {
        ...
        classpath 'org.kt3k.gradle.plugin:coveralls-gradle-plugin:2.4.0'
    }
}
```

Then we can apply the `coveralls` plugin, point it to the coverage reports directory and ensure it only runs on CI builds by adding the following to your main module's `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.github.kt3k.coveralls'
```

```groovy
coveralls {
    jacocoReportPath = "${buildDir}/reports/coverage/debug/report.xml"
}

tasks.coveralls {
    dependsOn 'connectedAndroidTest'
    onlyIf { System.env.'CI' }
}
```

Note that we also added a dependency on the `connectedAndroidTest` task as that is the one that will actually generate the code coverage report.

Let's now change the build task in the `travis.yml` so it runs the `coveralls` task after every build. While not strictly necessary to still define the `connectedAndroidTest` task, I prefer to do so as it makes it more explicit what `Gradle` will exactly be building.

```yaml
script:
  ...
  - ./gradlew connectedAndroidTest coveralls

```

Next we need to activate our GitHub repository in coveralls, so it picks up the output from the `Gradle` plugin. This can easily be done by clicking `add repos` on [coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io) and flipping the switch on your repository.

<center><a href="{{ site.blogbaseurl }}img/blog/traviscoveralls/coveralls-enableproject.png"><img src="{{ site.blogbaseurl }}img/blog/traviscoveralls/coveralls-enableproject.png" alt="Enable project in Coveralls"></a></center>

This will result in the project being added to your dashboard without any builds.

<center><a href="{{ site.blogbaseurl }}img/blog/traviscoveralls/coveralls-nobuilds.png"><img src="{{ site.blogbaseurl }}img/blog/traviscoveralls/coveralls-nobuilds.png" alt="No builds yet in Coveralls"></a></center>

Simply trigger a Travis build by pushing some changes to start seeing code coverage results online.

Finally you can easily add a badge to your repository by clicking the `Badge urls` button from the green banner in the detail view.

Congratulations you know have attractive code coverage reports for [your repository](https://coveralls.io/github/JeroenMols/TravisCoverallsExample)!

## Wrap-up
Adding Travis CI and Coveralls code coverage to your project is fairly straightforward once you know what works and especially what doesn't work. Hopefully this blogpost was able to remove a lot of those frustrating barriers of entry.

A basic example project with everything in this blogpost integrated is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/JeroenMols/TravisCoverallsExample). But in case you're interested in a real life example, have a look at my Android library [LandscapeVideoCamera](https://github.com/JeroenMols/LandscapeVideoCamera), which actually has decent code coverage statistics.

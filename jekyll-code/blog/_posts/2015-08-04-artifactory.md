Setting up your own maven repository and uploading artifacts to it via Maven is quite a daunting task. Therefore this blog post aims at clarifying how you can set up your own Maven repository via [Artifactory](http://www.jfrog.com/open-source/) and how to automate uploading your artifacts using Gradle.

Note that while some of the material here is focussed on Android, most of it is applicable more generally.

## Setting up a Repository Manager
First of all we need to make sure we have an actual Maven repository to upload our artifacts to. According to [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/repository-management.html) you should use a repository manager to do that:

> **Best Practice - Using a Repository Manager**

> A repository manager is a dedicated server application designed to manage repositories of binary components. The usage of a repository manager is considered an essential best practice for any significant usage of Maven.

### Why Artifactory?

While there are some options available to choose from, I personally selected [Artifactory](http://www.jfrog.com/open-source/) because:

- Clear and attractive UI
- Configure in less than a minute
- Did everything I needed: Maven, user access control, Gradle plugin,...
- Free and open source

For more information have a look at all of the [alternatives](https://maven.apache.org/repository-management.html), checkout this [feature comparison matrix](http://www.jfrog.com/blog/artifactory-vs-nexus-integration-matrix/) or checkout all of the [Artifactory features](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Artifactory+Comparison+Matrix).

### Verify you have Java SDK 8
Before you get started, make sure that you have Java SDK 8 installed, or otherwise Artifactory won't start. You can easily verify your Java version with `java -version`:

```bash
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_51"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_51-b16)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.51-b03, mixed mode)
```

If it doesn't output at least version `1.8.x`, you should [download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and install a new Java SDK before you continue.

Note that the error you would get if you don't have Java 8 looks like this:

```
Aug 05, 2015 9:29:31 AM org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext startInternal
SEVERE: One or more listeners failed to start. Full details will be found in the appropriate container log file
```

### Install Artifactory
Thankfully this is incredibly easy to do. Just download the latest version of [Artifactory](http://www.jfrog.com/open-source/), unpack the archive and run the `artifactory` executable for your platform.

<center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7ZSUHgHDMmc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

You can easily verify your installation and start experimenting with its features by navigating to [http://localhost:8081/artifactory/](http://localhost:8081/artifactory/). For now, don't worry about all of the settings, we will configure what we need later on.

### Configuring Gradle to upload Android artifacts
Let's upload a very simple archive by configuring a new Gradle task for our Android library project.

In your top level `build.gradle` file, add a reference to the repository of the Artifactory Gradle plugin:

```groovy
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath "org.jfrog.buildinfo:build-info-extractor-gradle:3.1.1"
    }
}
```

Next in your library we will need to apply two new plugins: one to prepare the Maven artifacts `maven-publish` and one to upload the archives to Artifactory ` com.jfrog.artifactory`:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.jfrog.artifactory'
apply plugin: 'maven-publish'
```

Every Maven artifact is identified by three different parameters:

- artifactId: the name of your library
- groupId: usually the package name of your library
- version: identifies different releases of the same artifact

As we can very easily generate the `artifactId` from the library project name, we only have to explicitly define the other two in the `build.gradle` file.

```groovy
def packageName = 'com.jmolsmobile.myawesomelibrary'
def libraryVersion = '1.0.0'
```

Now we need to configure the `maven-publish` plugin so that it knows which artifacts to publish to Artifactory. For our purpose we should refer to the `***-release.aar` file, generated by the `assembleRelease` task. Note that we can predict the name by taking the name of the Library project:

```groovy
publishing {
    publications {
        aar(MavenPublication) {
            groupId packageName
            version = libraryVersion
            artifactId project.getName()

            // Tell maven to prepare the generated "*.aar" file for publishing
            artifact("$buildDir/outputs/aar/${project.getName()}-release.aar")
        }
    }
}
```

Finally we need to configure the `com.jfrog.artifactory` plugin so it know to which repository it has to publish all the artifacts. For simplicity we will upload the artifact to the locally running Artifactory instance ([http://localhost:8081/artifactory](http://localhost:8081/artifactory)) and place it in the default `libs-release-local` repository. Note that the username `admin` and password `password` are hardcoded in this example, but we will provide a better solution for that later.

```groovy
artifactory {
    contextUrl = 'http://localhost:8081/artifactory'
    publish {
        repository {
            // The Artifactory repository key to publish to
            repoKey = 'libs-release-local'

            username = "admin"
            password = "password"
        }
        defaults {
            // Tell the Artifactory Plugin which artifacts should be published to Artifactory.
            publications('aar')
            publishArtifacts = true

            // Properties to be attached to the published artifacts.
            properties = ['qa.level': 'basic', 'dev.team': 'core']
            // Publish generated POM files to Artifactory (true by default)
            publishPom = true
        }
    }
}
```

### Deploying artifacts
Now that our Gradle buildscripts are properly configured we can easily publish artifacts to Artifactory by running the following command:

```
gradle assembleRelease artifactoryPublish
```

Notice how we first invoke `assembleRelease` before we invoke the actual `artifactoryPublish` task, because we of the way we defined the artifacts to publish in the previous section.

### Using the artifacts
To make use of the published artifacts in another project we have to add our Artifactory repository to the list of Maven repositories to use in your top level `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "http://localhost:8081/artifactory/libs-release-local" }
    }
}
```

After we can simply add the artifact as a dependency in the `build.gradle` file of our main project:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile "com.jmolsmobile.myawesomelibrary:1.0.0"
}

## Wrap-up
Congratulations! You now have a fully working Maven repository manager with a Gradle script to generate and upload your artifacts.

In the next blog post I will zoom in on some more advanced topics such as:

- Library projects with dependencies
- Configuring your own repositories
- User access management and rights
- Removing hardcoded username and password from `build.gradle`

I have also uploaded a complete example on GitHub for your reference.
